Jun 2, 2020 - With today's planetary alignment, you may get a chance to talk to someone rather special. The topics of conversation may not be quite what you had imagined discussing with them, but it is a start. Even if you don't feel you have anything profound to contribute, keep going. They will notice you and will certainly want to know more about you. Take decisive action.

Jun 3, 2020 - Don't worry if things don't go according to plan today, as the current astral configuration is creating a very interesting cosmic climate right now. If you are looking for someone very special, then you won't connect with them in any of your usual ways. You need to range far and wide, and do things that are quite different from the ones you usually do - but you won't be disappointed.
